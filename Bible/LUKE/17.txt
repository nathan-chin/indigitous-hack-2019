Sin, Faith, Duty
1: Jesus said to his disciples: [r)"Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come.(r] 
2: [r) It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.(r] 
3: [r) So watch yourselves.(r] [r)"If your brother or sister(r] [r) sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them.(r] 
4: [r) Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them."(r] 
5: The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!" 
6: He replied, [r)"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.(r] 
7: [r)"Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’?(r] 
8: [r) Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?(r] 
9: [r) Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?(r] 
10: [r) So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’ "(r] 
Jesus Heals Ten Men With Leprosy
11: Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 
12: As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance 
13: and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!" 
14: When he saw them, he said, [r)"Go, show yourselves to the priests."(r] And as they went, they were cleansed. 
15: One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 
16: He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan. 
17: Jesus asked, [r)"Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?(r] 
18: [r) Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?"(r] 
19: Then he said to him, [r)"Rise and go; your faith has made you well."(r] 
The Coming of the Kingdom of God
20: Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, [r)"The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed,(r] 
21: [r) nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst."(r] 
22: Then he said to his disciples, [r)"The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.(r] 
23: [r) People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them.(r] 
24: [r) For the Son of Man in his day(r] [r) will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.(r] 
25: [r) But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.(r] 
26: [r)"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.(r] 
27: [r) People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.(r] 
28: [r)"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.(r] 
29: [r) But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.(r] 
30: [r)"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.(r] 
31: [r) On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.(r] 
32: [r) Remember Lot’s wife!(r] 
33: [r) Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.(r] 
34: [r) I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.(r] 
35: [r) Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."(r] 
[36]: 
37:"Where, Lord?" they asked. He replied, [r)"Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."(r]

Jesus Prays to Be Glorified
1: After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: [r)"Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.(r] 
2: [r) For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.(r] 
3: [r) Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.(r] 
4: [r) I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.(r] 
5: [r) And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.(r] 
Jesus Prays for His Disciples
6: [r)"I have revealed you(r] [r) to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.(r] 
7: [r) Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.(r] 
8: [r) For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.(r] 
9: [r) I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.(r] 
10: [r) All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.(r] 
11: [r) I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of(r] [r) your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.(r] 
12: [r) While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by(r] [r) that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.(r] 
13: [r)"I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.(r] 
14: [r) I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.(r] 
15: [r) My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.(r] 
16: [r) They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.(r] 
17: [r) Sanctify them by(r] [r) the truth; your word is truth.(r] 
18: [r) As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.(r] 
19: [r) For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.(r] 
Jesus Prays for All Believers
20: [r)"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,(r] 
21: [r) that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.(r] 
22: [r) I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one--(r] 
23: [r) I in them and you in me--so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.(r] 
24: [r)"Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.(r] 
25: [r)"Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.(r] 
26: [r) I have made you(r] [r) known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."(r]

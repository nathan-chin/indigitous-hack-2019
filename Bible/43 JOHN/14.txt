Jesus Comforts His Disciples
1: [r)"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God(r] [r); believe also in me.(r] 
2: [r) My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?(r] 
3: [r) And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.(r] 
4: [r) You know the way to the place where I am going."(r] 
Jesus the Way to the Father
5: Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" 
6: Jesus answered, [r)"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.(r] 
7: [r) If you really know me, you will know(r] [r) my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."(r] 
8: Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us." 
9: Jesus answered: [r)"Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?(r] 
10: [r) Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.(r] 
11: [r) Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.(r] 
12: [r) Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.(r] 
13: [r) And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.(r] 
14: [r) You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.(r] 
Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit
15: [r)"If you love me, keep my commands.(r] 
16: [r) And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever--(r] 
17: [r) the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be(r] [r) in you.(r] 
18: [r) I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.(r] 
19: [r) Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.(r] 
20: [r) On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.(r] 
21: [r) Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them."(r] 
22: Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" 
23: Jesus replied, [r)"Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.(r] 
24: [r) Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.(r] 
25: [r)"All this I have spoken while still with you.(r] 
26: [r) But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.(r] 
27: [r) Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.(r] 
28: [r)"You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.(r] 
29: [r) I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.(r] 
30: [r) I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,(r] 
31: [r) but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.(r] [r)"Come now; let us leave.(r]
